FUNDAMENTALS OF STORY-TELLING
Translating technical results
Impacting decision making problems
Not about spinning results
Making results stick:
	* Simple
	* Concrete
	* Credible
The best results have no impact without proper presentation.
Convince change-adverse stakeholders.
Storytelling is a mechanism for sharing insights backed up by a compelling narrative 
and visualizations.

They can use:
Anecdotes (imagination)
Stories (memorable)
Add value (provide context)
Capture audience's attention
Facilitate decision-making
Drive change

--CONCEPTS
  * 3 minutes story. Whay wwould you say in 3 minutes
  * Big idea. One sentence.
  These have to be clear and concise.
Our story should always contain actionable insights. That is 
a result that can lead to an action.
--NARRATIVE
  * Avoid diconnected facts and focus on a central insight.
  * Explain context
  * The narrative should follow a linear sequence
  * Do not include misleading graphs.

Benefits of data storytelling:
  * Helps focus attention
  * Meaning and context
  * Helps retain insights
  * Better infomed decision-making
  * Persuade change-resistant
 
--TECH OR NON-TECH APPROACH
Data profeccionals care about their methods, 
but the audience likely cares more about results and implications.
This requires translating results into Stories. Easy to understand, engage audience, drive changes, strategies.

--Awereness
What is the background of our audience.
Instead of telling them how our model works, they should understand impact and limitations.
Be converstaional when they have a question.
Do not explain why we chose the variables, instead explain the context in which our model works.
The level of information they need is non-technical.

--ADEPT...use things the audience may understand:
  * Analogy
  * Diagram
  * Example
  * Plain english
  * Techincal definition
 Technical jargon
  * Acronyms could help or hurt the communication if not everyone understands it.
  * Translate terminology into simpler terms.
Be receptive to quetions as the audinece may not understand everything.

DATA STORY TELLING has three elements:
  * Data
  * Narrative
  * Visuals
Meaningful way to target audience.
Prioritize key points

NARRATIVE:
First a background should contain: motivation, changes, focus.
Then throw an insight with supporting evidence.
Climax. Introduce the central finding of our analysis. What could happen if nothing changes?

DATA
SELECTING THE RIGTH DATA
This means including enough information contextual insights in a story 
to better support the main point without overloading with information.

Adapt the insights to the audience.
A stakeholder is any person interested in the project outcome
or a decision or activity derived from it. They can be techincal or non-technical.

Be aware of the:
  * Role (CEO, investor, director, founder)
  * Knowledge (and their interest in the story)
  * Right data to show.
 Audience skepticism. The audience will have different levels of skepticism.
 For that:
   * Convice yourself
   * Convince a friend
   * Convince a skeptic
 
 SHOWING RELEVANT STATISTICS
 Variations can be shown in abssolute terms or relative terms.
 Absolute is better for a a single value, for several values it is better relative.
 
 Same is true for proportion changes. If comparing different values for several
 categories it is better to use relative changes to account for size.

VISUALIZATIONS
Expertise and Familiarity

You could use similar graphs for both investor and techincal lead.
However the techincal lead will require additional plots to reinforce the resulta.

Pareto principle: Aggregate less relevant data.
Make plots approachable and engaging.

McCandless method:
1. Introduce visualization by name
2. Answer audience's questions
3. State insights
4. Help the audience relate

CHOOSING THE APPROPIATE FORMAT
Key information engaging and easy to understand.

Oral communication.
Pros: Relationship with the audience. Immediate feedback. Non-verbal cues.
Cons. No permament record of cummunication.Not suitable for long messages.

Written communication.
Pros. Permanente record of communication. Shared with large audience. Less emotional reactions.
Cons. Hard to see if the message was understood. No immediate feedback.

TYPES OF REPORTS
They can be final or summary reports, and further they can be:
Informational (factual information, short, not strict structure, inform about facts)
Analytical (analysis, could be long or short, strict structure, data-driven decisions)

FINAL REPORTS
They include:
  * Data analysis
  * Findings and results
  * Visuals
SUMMARY REPORTS
  * Key findings, recommendations
  * Visuals
  * Format (<5 pages) 
  * Link to main documment
 
 Strucutre for analytical, summary and final reports.
 1. Introduction (purpose, contextual information, question of analysis)
 2. Body (data with descriptions and tables, methods, analysis using visuals, results with description and visuals)
 3. Conclusions (summarize important results)

REPRODUCIBILITY AND REFERENCES
Our results should be reproducible after following our instructions in the methodology.
That is regardless of the environment and the data is processed in the same way (perhaps using a different language)
  * Prevents duplication of effort.
  * It allows to build upon pre-existing WORK
  * Focus on new challenge
  * Peer review
  * Tool agnostic
  
1. Keep track of how the results were produced:
  * Well document scripts (comments in code)
  * List packages and environment used
  * Version control
2. Avoid manual data manipulation:
  * Data versioning
  * Store raw data and intermidiate steps
  * Adpat and resolve problems
3. Control randomness
  * Use random seeds
4. Interpretability
  * Understand the cause of a decision
  * Story compelling results
5. Cite bibliography correctly
REFERENCES
A citation is the basic information required to identify and locate a specific publication.

WRITE PRECISE AND CLEAR REPORTS
A report must be clear, concise and precise.

Empty phrases. Avoid these as they contain no information (it is interesting to note that, the fact that, it should be noted that)
Be straightforward.

Write concrete nouns and avoid 'this, that, it'
Active voice: criticized for refering to the AUTHORIZATION.
Passive voice: stuffy and hard to read.

In academic context use passive, but in businees context use active.
Redundant adjectives and adverbs (done previously, etc.)
Run-on sentences. When two independent clauses are connected with wrong punctuation.

REPORT ON CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the probability of defaulting.
Audience: Non-technical stakeholders, band decision-making
Write a story forst a background then introduce the insights, the climax.

Translate technical results for non-technical audience.
Choose the correct data and visulations to show for the audience.

PLANNING AN ORAL PRESENTATION
Always have a plan before building slides.
Presentation structure:
  * purpose
  * audience
  * message
Type of presentation:
  * Informative (tell)
  * Instructional (explain)
  * Persuasive (conivnce)
Audience:
  * Technical colleagues
  * Manager or executive team
  * Customer
Size:
  * Small meeting
  * Conference or large meeting
  * Workshop

Remember thath after a week almost 90% will be forgotten:
What do we want to stick with them?

Opening statment. Capture audience's attention

Central message. One sentence

Closing statement. Sums up the preentation and strenghtens central message.

Outline. 
  * Graphs and Visuals
  * Sections(five in general or less)
KEEP TIME IN MIND

BUILDING slides
They support the story, they should be short and dynamic
Do not measure slides for timing, instead focus on having one message per slide.

Color can emphasize or cloud the message. Use the least to convey the message.
Keep good contrast for text. Use appropiate fonts.
It is possible to use several fonts, change the spacing of letters and lines and use bold, itatlic and size.

Use bold and bigger size for headline
It is advised to use a layered approach (highlighting text or graph)


DELIVERING THE PRESENTATION
An important point is to practice. 
A script could be helpfull but don't memorize, instead use it as a guideline to connect messages.
Become familiar with content. anticipate follow-up question.

Pratice involves: standing up, using the slide and speaking out loud.
Detect distracting patterns (um, so, like, basically, etc.)
Find linking statements.

Be aware of our emotions. Look confident as this gives confidence in our content.
Use eye contact, interactivity, questions. (Talk to them not at them)
Develop a relationship (do not make them feel bad if they do not understand something)
Avoid words like as WE know, or obviously.
Pace, use pauses, and change speed of talk to emphasize.

AVOIDING COMMON ERRORS
Audience has attention span of around 20 minutes so be aware of that.
State the purpose at the beginning.
As speakers we should guide the audience.
Do not leave all findings to the end.

DO NOT THINK OF IT AS A MONOLOGUE.
Engage and involve audience, make an introduction.
State key assumptions, ask questions. Reiterate the main idea.
Posture and natural movements support the  message.
Use different voice tonalities, speed, volume (loud enough)
  Intonation also matters (sound engaged)
